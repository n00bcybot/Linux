# Lesson 1
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# All these commands do the same thing

ls -al
ls -a -l
ls --all --format=long

# External and internal (built in the shell) commands

type echo
echo is a shell builtin

type man
man is /usr/bin/man

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Quoting
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# In this example, using the touch command and string variable with space will actually create 2 separate files
TWOWORDS="two words"
touch $TWOWORDS

# Using the same variable inside double quotes creates a single file called "two words".The 3 special characters are interpreted as such ($, \ and `).
# Spaces in names are not best practice.
touch "$TWOWORDS"

# Another example - the value of the variable is still read inside the double quotes
echo I am $USER
I am tom
echo "I am $USER"
I am tom

# Inside single quotes it produses literal string - special characters are not recognized
touch '$TWOWORDS'

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Escape Characters
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This command will print the name of the variable and not it's value. The backslash escapes the $ special character

echo \$USER
$USER

# Creating multiple files with array 

touch game{1..5}
ls
game1 game2 game3 game4 game5

# Removing the files. The question mark acts as a wild card
rm game?
ls


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variables
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Local variables - available to the current shell session only
# Environment variables - available both in the local session and subprocesses spawned from it. 

greeting=hello

# There must be no space between "=" and the variable name and value. To print the value of a variable, use $ in front of it.
# To clear/remove the value of a variable, use unset
unset greeting

# Global variable
# To make a variable available to subprocesses, turn it from a local into an environment variable. This is done by the command export. Make sure to not use $ in this case
export greeting

# Creating global variable and instatiating it in the same time
export greeting=hello


# Print all environment variables 
env

# Print $PATH variable
echo $PATH

# Append a new directory to the $PATH variable
PATH=$PATH:new_directory

#! The order of elements in PATH also defines the lookup order

# Side quest - share Joplin notes on dual boot system (Joplin synchronization via FileSystem)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This requires creating a new partition on a hard disk accessible from both systems (created in this case via Windows Disk Manager - Shrink Volume) as well as
# permanently mounting the partition via editing /etc/fstub

# Get the UUID of the partition
sudo blkid

# Edit /etc/fstab
sudo nano /etc/fstab

# Adding the UUID. "nofail" is added to allow the system to boot in case it cannot mount the partition
# "defaults" is a shorthand that applies a set of common options for mounting. For NTFS, this includes read-write permissions, automatic mounting, etc
# the first 0 means "don't back up the file system" (i.e., itâ€™s not used for dump backups).
# the second 0 means "don't run fsck on this partition" (the system will not check the NTFS partition during boot).
UUID=uuid-here /home/username/directory ntfs-3g defaults, nofail  0 0

# Check if mounted
df -h

# Show all devices and their mount points
lsblk
