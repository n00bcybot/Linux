Intorduction
	- one of the most popular operating systems, certainly most popular for servers; runs on embeded devices, kindles, Raspberry Pi, mobile phones (Android), desktops etc.
	- created by Linus Torvalds in 1991; ideas heavily borrowed from UNIX, however no UNIX code exists in Linux; 
	- created with the idea to provide operating system for "small" (as compared to mainframe, room-sized computers) computers
	- created as free and open source alternative to UNIX

Distributions
	- "A Linux distribution is a bundle that consists of a Linux kernel and a selection of applications that are maintained by a company or user community"
	- classification by purpose: desktop and server
	- distribution families:
		- Debian - the biggest family
			- launched by Ian Murdock in 1993
			- it does not provide proprietary software by default
			- known for stability
			- dpkg package provider
		- Ubuntu - popular desktop version of Debian Linux
			- created by Mark Shuttleworth and his team in 2004
			-  has a scheduled release every six months with a long-term support release every 2 years
		- Red Hat (RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linux) - developed and maintained by Red Hat, which was acquired by IBM in 2019, commercial support, optimized for servers
			- enterprise solution
			- rpm package provider
		- CentOS - free version of Red Hat, no commercial support, optimized for servers, rpm package provider
		- Fedora - founded in 2003, progressive, constant updates and the latest tech, good test-bed, rpm package provider
		- SUSE   - released in 1994 by SUSE, a German company, itself founded in 1992
			- YaST package provider

Embeded Systems
	- combination of computer hardware and software designed to have a specific function within a larger system
	- Android and Raspberry Pi

	- Android - founded in 2003, bought by Google in 2005
	- Raspberry Pi - credit-card sized computer, programmable via Raspbian, a Linux version designed for it
		- uses ARM processor
		- boots from SD card

Linux and the Cloud
	- Linux runs 90% of the public cloud workload
	- is usually offered as part of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering

Guided Exercises

	1. How is Debian GNU/Linux different from Ubuntu? Name two aspects.

		- Stability vs. Up-to-Date Software 
			Debian prioritizes stability and reliability, making it a preferred choice for servers. Its Stable release undergoes rigorous testing before being released, meaning software versions may be older.
			Ubuntu is based on Debian but includes newer software and more frequent updates, making it more user-friendly and suitable for desktops.
		- Release Cycle
			Debian does not follow a fixed release schedule; new stable versions are released when they are deemed ready, usually every 2–3 years.
			Ubuntu follows a predictable release cycle, with new versions every six months and Long-Term Support (LTS) releases every two years, providing five years of support.

	2. What are the most common environments/platforms Linux is used for? Name three different environments/platforms and name one distribution you can use for each.
		
		 - Servers – Linux is widely used in web hosting, cloud computing, and enterprise environments due to its stability and security.
			Recommended Distribution: Ubuntu Server (or Debian for more stability)
		
		 - Embedded Systems & IoT – Linux powers many embedded devices such as routers, smart TVs, and IoT gadgets.
			Recommended Distribution: Yocto Project (Poky) or OpenWrt

		 - Desktop Computing – Linux is a popular choice for personal and professional desktop use.
			Recommended Distribution: Fedora (or Ubuntu Desktop for beginners)

	3. You are planning to install a Linux distribution in a new environment. Name four things that you should consider when choosing a distribution.

		- cost, performance, scalability, how stable it is and the hardware demand of the system.

	4. Name three devices that the Android OS runs on, other than smartphones
		- cameras, TVs, watches

	5. Explain three major advantages of cloud computing.
		- high availability, scalability, reliability, flexibility, cost afficiency

Explorational Exercises

	1. Considering cost and performance, which distributions are mostly suitable for a business that aims to reduce licensing costs, while keeping performance at its highest? Explain why.

		Debian – A completely free and open-source distribution with a focus on stability and efficiency. It has low system overhead, making it ideal for high-performance workloads without licensing fees.
		Rocky Linux / AlmaLinux – Free, enterprise-grade alternatives to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), providing the same performance and reliability but without the subscription costs. Ideal for businesses migrating from RHEL.
		Ubuntu Server (LTS) – Offers a balance of performance, ease of use, and community support while eliminating licensing costs. The LTS versions provide long-term stability, making it a strong choice for production environments.

		Why These?
		No Licensing Fees – Unlike RHEL or Windows Server, these distributions are free to use.
		Optimized Performance – Lightweight, stable, and capable of handling enterprise workloads efficiently.
		Long-Term Support & Security – Debian and Ubuntu LTS offer long-term support, while Rocky and AlmaLinux provide RHEL-level reliability without the cost.
	
	2. What are the major advantages of the Raspberry Pi and which functions can they take in business?

		Low Cost – Raspberry Pi devices are affordable, making them cost-effective for various business applications.
		Low Power Consumption – They consume very little electricity, making them energy-efficient for continuous operation.
		Compact & Portable – Their small size allows easy deployment in various environments.
		Versatile & Customizable – Supports different Linux distributions and can be tailored for specific business needs.
		Strong Community Support – Extensive documentation and a large community provide troubleshooting and development resources.

		Business Applications of Raspberry Pi:
		IoT & Automation – Used in smart office automation, environmental monitoring, and industrial control systems.
		Digital Signage – Acts as a media player for displaying advertisements, announcements, or dashboards.
		Network Monitoring & Security – Can function as a network monitoring tool, firewall, or VPN server.
		Edge Computing & Data Logging – Processes data locally before sending it to cloud services, reducing latency.
		Thin Clients & Workstations – Can serve as low-cost thin clients for accessing virtual desktops in businesses.

	3. What range of distributions does Amazon Cloud Services and Google Cloud offer? Name at least three common ones and two different ones.

		Amazon Web Services (AWS):
		
		Amazon Linux (AWS Exclusive) – Optimized for AWS with built-in security updates and integration.
		Ubuntu – Popular for cloud deployments, widely used by developers.
		Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) – Enterprise-grade, secure, and stable for production workloads.
		SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) – Preferred for SAP workloads and enterprise environments.
		Debian – Stable and lightweight, used in various cloud applications.

		Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
		Container-Optimized OS (GCP Exclusive) – A lightweight OS designed for running containers efficiently.
		Ubuntu – Frequently used due to its ease of setup and long-term support versions.
		Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) – Provides enterprise stability with official support.
		Debian – Offers stability, security, and compatibility with many cloud workloads.
		Rocky Linux – A free, community-supported alternative to CentOS, optimized for cloud performance.
