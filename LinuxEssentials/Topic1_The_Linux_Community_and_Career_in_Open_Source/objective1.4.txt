Linux User Interfaces

	Desktop Environments
		
		Gnome - keep it simple
			GTK toolkit (written in the C language)
			
		KDE - larger selection of applications and giving the user the opportunity to change every configuration setting
			Qt library (written in C++)

Getting to the Command Line

	Gnome Terminal
	Konsole (KDE)
	other options

Presentations and Projects

	LibreOffice Impress (Microsoft Office substitute)
	ODP (part of Open Document Format)

	Beamer -  LaTeX class that can create slide presentations from LaTeX code
	LaTeX - typesetting system largely used for writing scientific documents, capacity to handle complex math symbols
	Reveal.js, an awesome NPM package (NPM is the default NodeJS package manager) which allows you to create beautiful presentations by using the web
	GanttProject
	ProjectLibre

Industry Uses of Linux

	stability, flexibility and performance
	68% of the website servers on the Internet are powered by Unix and the biggest portion of those are known to be Linux
	significant portion of Linux systems nowadays run in the cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
	
	IaaS - share the resources of a large server by offering access to virtual machines via hypervisor
	Linux has three well know open source hypervisors: Xen, KVM and VirtualBox
		Xen - the oldest
		KVM - the most popular, sponsored by Red Hat
		VirtualBox - Oracle

	PaaS - Heroku, program code can just be run without taking care of the underlying containers and virtual machines

	SaaS - Dropbox and Salesforce

Privacy Issues when using the Internet

	Cookie Tracking - enables tracking of your activity on the web via small files stored on your computer
	Do Not Track (DNT) - not guaranteed add opt-out
	“Private” Windows - in "private" mode the browser cretes a new session and  deletes all data generated in that session upon closing

Choosing the Right Password

	Do not use easy to guess numbers, like birthdays or password123
	KeePass - stores passwords in encrypted file on the local system
	BitWarden - stores passwords in the cloud

Encryption

	Transport Layer Security (TLS) - successor of SSL

File and E-mail Encryption With GnuPG

	GNU Privacy Guard - can be used to sign, encrypt, and decrypt texts, e-mails, files, directories, and even whole disk partitions, works with public and private key
	
Disk Encryption

	two methods available: stacked and block device encryption
	stacked - files and directories are encrypted before being stored on the filesystem and decrypted after reading them
	block - happens below the filesystem layer, making sure everything that is written to a block device is encrypted
	dm-crypt - the de-facto standard for block encryption for Linux systems
